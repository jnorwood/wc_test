This is a test program to check the execution time of various parallel operations that would be used in counting lines and words.
Use it by wctest alice*.txt in order to count the 10 supplied text files in parallel.
It will measure several alternative functions and display the count.   It uses the argv_expand to enable wildcards on windows.
